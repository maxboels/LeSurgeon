# Robot Calibration Results - September 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Successfully Calibrated Robots

Both robots have been calibrated and the calibration data has been automatically saved by LeRobot.

### Follower Arm (`lesurgeon_follower_arm`)
**Calibrated:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL  
**File location:** `/home/maxboels/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/so101_follower/lesurgeon_follower_arm.json`

**Joint Range Values:**
```

gripper         |   1830 |   1850 |   3340
```

### Leader Arm (`lesurgeon_leader_arm`)
**Calibrated:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL  
**File location:** `/home/maxboels/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/teleoperators/so101_leader/lesurgeon_leader_arm.json`

**Joint Range Values:**
```
NAME            |    MIN |    POS |    MAX

## üìÅ Calibration File Locations

LeRobot automatically saves calibration data in the Hugging Face cache directory:

- **Follower calibration:** `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/so101_follower/lesurgeon_follower_arm.json`
- **Leader calibration:** `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/teleoperators/so101_leader/lesurgeon_leader_arm.json`

## üéØ Usage

These calibration files will be automatically loaded when you use your robot IDs:
- `lesurgeon_follower_arm` - for the follower robot
- `lesurgeon_leader_arm` - for the leader/teleoperator robot

## üîß Troubleshooting Notes

The leader arm calibration initially failed several times with "Magnitude exceeds 2047" errors, but succeeded after manually positioning the joints closer to center. Key lesson: **always position joints near center before calibration**.

## ‚ú® Next Steps

Your robots are now ready for:
- Data recording sessions
- Training runs
- Teleoperation tasks
- Any LeRobot experiments

The calibration ensures accurate joint position mapping and proper range limits for safe operation.
